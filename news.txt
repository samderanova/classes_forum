Currently making a MERN app, unless someone wants to do something different
Therefore, downloaded libraries that will be installed (but haven't been installed yet; waiting 
for the rest of the team) are:
    Frontend:
        react, react-dom, react-router, react-router-dom
        any css frameworks? Sass (Node-Sass)? Maybe foundation?
        any css libraries? Bootstrap/Material UI

    Backend:
        mongoose - allows us to create MongoDB schemas (the JSON data of users)
        cors - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (allows us to send requests to other domains)
        express - JS to create backend
        dotenv - take in and use environment variables in a .env file
        body-parser - a middleware that parses incoming request bodies
        nodemon - automatically refreshes the localhost backend server upon saving (like React)
        axios - a library used to send HTTP requests

    Specifically, the MongoDB we plan to use is MongoDB Atlas.

    Backend Notes:
    HTTP request types:
        GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
        Get - retrieve items from server/database
        Post - create new item in the database
        Put - update or replace item in the database
        Patch - update or modify item in the database
        Delete - delete item from database


    Layout:
        - Login page: 'https://www.url.com/login'
        - Main home page (after logging in) 'https://www.url.com/main': we probably shouldn't include the 
        username in the url due to security vulnerabilities
